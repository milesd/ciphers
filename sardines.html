<H1>Crypto Sardines</H1>

This page contains the inspired work of Alex Stewart (aka Riche), and
his friend Rui Mendez.  They wrote a version of the rsa-perl script
which looks like a sardine!  Several variations of this follow, please
note they all still run, and are valid fully working non-US exportable
perl scripts implementing RSA encryption.  For Alex's exposition of
this <EM>amazing</EM> feat in combined ascii art and perl hackery read
on ...

At one point, some time back, some friends and I were conversing
online about various things, and as it happened, the conversation
turned to one of sardines, for some reason or other which I can't
recall at this particular time..  Another, parallel conversation which
was also occurring at the time happened to be discussing the RSA PERL
crypto-sig, your web pages, and related issues.  Anyway, as things are
often wont to do when one is conversing online far too late into the
wee hours of the morning, these two threads managed to merge
themselves inextricably, and, well, one thing just kinda led to
another, and, well..

<P>
It is my pleasure to present to you the first ever known specimen in captivity
of the North American RSA Crypto-Sardine (sardina cryptographicus),
captured for your perusal by myself
(Alex Stewart <A HREF="mailto:riche@crl.com">&lt;riche@crl.com&gt;</A>), 
and by my associate, 
Rui Mendez <A HREF="mailto:azuki@di.uminho.pt">&lt;azuki@di.uminho.pt&gt;</A>:

And yes, as you are no doubt pondering, the above sardine is, in fact, also a
valid and executable PERL script, which is perfectly compatible with existing
crypto-sig software.

<P>

But then I got to thinking..  How do we know this specimen is, in fact,
actually a sardine and not some fishy imposter?  Well, I cleverly devised a
test.  If it is indeed a sardine, then it must be possible to pack it tightly
with others of its kind in traditional sardine fashion..  And so:

Yes, indeed, it does in fact not only pack well with its sardinian buddies,
but the above even also functions as an executable script, just like its
solitary counterpart (in fact, it's even possible to duplicate the 3rd and 4th
lines of the 10-line script as many times as desired (producing additional
fish), while retaining its functionality).  I am therefore confident in my
analysis of this specimen as definitely a sardine variety crypto-fish.
<p>
At this point it also occurred to me that now we have all these verified
crypto-sardines all over the place, we would undoubtedly soon need some form
of container to prevent them from getting out of hand..  I therefore present
to you my last development in this area to date, the crypto-sardine can:

So far little is known about the feeding, migration, or mating patterns of
this new specimen, but tests and monitoring in these areas are continuing..
